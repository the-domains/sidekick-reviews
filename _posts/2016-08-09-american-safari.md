American Safari

The word safari conjures up images of well-to-do British folks moving through the African landscape, kept in a measure of relative luxury by a small army of less-fortunate servants. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/33162e6e-530e-4f0f-b31e-00957bbc63e2.jpg)

The Safari imagined here represents something more uniquely American. 

1\. DIY Adventure

First, an American
Safari is a do-it-yourself (DIY) adventure. No expensive sherpas or personal
guides required. I do not diminish such experiences. When you are traveling in
difficult or unfamiliar terrain a guide or a helping hand can be invaluable.

But the American Safari is about individual self-reliance. It is about the freedom to be the architect of your own adventure. Whether you are traveling solo or in a pack, an American Safari makes epic natural beauty affordable and accessible to virtually any person. 

2\. Easy living

As Tom Petty put it,
you don't have to live like a refugee. 

When you go backcountry camping your entire world must fit into a backpack. This means smaller tents, harder beds, and sometimes even shorter toothbrushes. Compromises are inevitable in this never-ending dance between weight and comfort. 

American Safari is different from backpacking. It aspires to the level of comfort achieved by the romantic British safari without all the fuss about luxury. This means better food, bigger tents, proper beds, and even rugs to greet your feet when you crawl out of those beds in the morning. It means having access to the "stuff" that enhances life in nature. 

3\. The Automobile

For better or worse,
our country was built for the car. Maybe it's an expression of America's
celebrated belief in individual freedom. Maybe it is because the first cars
manufactured for the common man were invented here. Whatever it is, the
automobile lies at the heart of the American Safari. It liberates us from the
limitations of the backpack as it carries us out of our cities and towns and
out into the natural beauty of the forests, mountains, deserts, swamps, and
shorelines.

4\. The Park

The network of
national, state, and private parks that dot the American wilderness provide the
perfect gateway to nature.

Because they are accessible by automobile, parks allow you to drive to within 100 yards of your camp. A few quick trips back and forth to unload the car and you have everything you need for a night, a week, or a even a month of living in nature. 

Whether it's a public or private campground that offers hot showers and flush toilets for a few dollars a night, or whether it's a free primitive campsite located off some Forest Service Road out in the wilderness, the century-old conservation movement that produced the network of parks and preserves that protects our natural habitat is quintessentially American. 

America's parks
belong to us all, and they are waiting....
